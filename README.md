## About Me

I am a Computer Systems Engineer, recently graduated from Carleton University, with a strong foundation in both hardware and software technologies. My academic journey focused on the design and integration of complex systems, fueling my passion for continuous learning and innovation.

I am proficient in a range of programming languages, including Java, Python, C++, Go, C, and assembly, allowing me to build robust solutions and tackle diverse software challenges. My skills extend to web and user interface development with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, where I have designed and optimized responsive web interfaces.

On the hardware side, I have hands-on experience with microcontrollers such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno/Due, as well as PCB and ASIC development, which has given me a solid background in prototyping and hardware-software integration.

A recent highlight is my work on a Music Voting and Community Platform, developed from May 2024 to the present. This dynamic web application, built using Python Flask and Firebase, demonstrates my capabilities in full-stack development and cloud integration. I implemented secure user authentication and session management, designed RESTful APIs for voting and leaderboard features, and integrated real-time data storage with Firebase Firestore. The project also involved developing responsive frontends with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring data integrity through custom sanitization, and utilizing Git for version control and collaboration.

In addition to this project, I have completed group assignments involving embedded systems, wiring, soldering, and coding for real-world applications, further showcasing my ability to bridge hardware and software domains.

Professionally, I have worked as a Sales Associate at Tommy Hilfiger, where I received multiple Employee of the Month awards and contributed to the storeâ€™s ranking among the top 10 in Canada. This experience enhanced my communication, teamwork, and customer service skills and demonstrated my adaptability and effectiveness in fast-paced environments.

I am recognized as a strong communicator and collaborator, an effective problem-solver, and someone skilled in time management and multitasking. Currently, I am actively pursuing my P. Eng designation and seeking real-world engineering experience to further develop my expertise and contribute to impactful projects.
